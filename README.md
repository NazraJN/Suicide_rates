# Suicide_rates

# Overview
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), suicide is a significant global public health issue, accounting for more than 1 in every 100 deaths worldwide. The WHO estimates that approximately 800,000 people die by suicide annually, with around 80% of these suicides occurring in low and middle-income countries. A concerning trend is that the global suicide rate is more than twice as high among men as it is among women.

The reduction of suicide mortality is a key priority for the WHO, recognizing the need for comprehensive strategies to address this preventable cause of death. This priority is reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically under target 3.4, which aims to "reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promote mental health and wellbeing." This underscores the importance of mental health promotion and suicide prevention efforts as integral components of public health initiatives worldwide.

# Objectives
1. To examine the trend in suicide rates between 1950 to 2005
2. To compare variations in suicide rates by country
3. To compare variations in suicide rates by gender

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) and is curated by Gapminder using data from WHO Violence and Injury Prevention (VIP) and WHO Global Burden of Disease 2002 and 2004. It provides information on age-adjusted suicide rates among males and females from 1950 to 2005.

The dataset includes the following fields:

Entity: The name of the country or region.
Year: The year of the recorded data.
Male suicide rates for selected countries, 1950-2005 (WHO (2005)): Age-adjusted male suicide rates per 100,000 population for selected countries.
Female suicide rates for selected countries, 1950-2005 (WHO (2005)): Age-adjusted female suicide rates per 100,000 population for selected countries.
